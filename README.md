What motivated me to do this project?
I am very fond of playing games, and right from start I wished I could learn how to make the games and what are the requirements to build a basic game.
This is my first coding project and I learnt many things while creating it!!

Things to improve in the game:
Multiple lives for the player
Enemies and Players to attack
Score keeping
Advancing levels
Songs of users choice to be played in the game
